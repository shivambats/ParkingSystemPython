Parking System In Python

- Parking Lot can have multiple floors
- Floors can have multiple entry exit points
- Spot are filled/vacated based on floors
- It is assumed that the name and distance for all the spots will be unique as per all entry-exit points
- When a vehicle enters the lot, the nearest spot to the entry point is selected using min-heap

Scope
- Spots can be distinguished based on sizes, for now the size is only being used to calculate the fare
- The trigger operation when a spot is filled/vacated can be optimized.
- Test Cases
